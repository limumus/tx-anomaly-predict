/**
 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable through an associated {ProxyAdmin} instance.
 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector
 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two
 * things that go hand in hand:
 *
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to
 * the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating
 * the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a
 * dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to
 * call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and
 * allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative
 * interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.
 *
 * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
 * inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch
 * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to
 * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
 * implementation.
 *
 * NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a
 * meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an
 * immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be
 * overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an
 * undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin.
 *
 * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the
 * compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new
 * function and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This
 * could render the `upgradeToAndCall` function inaccessible, preventing upgradeability and compromising transparency.
