    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe main purpose of this function is to handle a process where a user \"burns\" a specific amount of tokens. Burning tokens typically means permanently removing them from circulation. The function also ensures that the user is registered in the system, checks if the user has an invitation, and calculates the value of the burned tokens in another currency (likely ETH). Finally, it distributes rewards or fees based on the burned amount.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \n- **`require(amount >= 0, \"TeaFactory: insufficient funds\")`:** Ensures the amount being burned is valid (not negative).  \n- **`require(payable(address(_burnToken)).balance >= deserved, 'not enough balance')`:** Checks if there is enough balance in the contract to handle the transaction.  \n- **`if(Invitation[sender] == address(0) && _invitation != address(0) && _invitation != sender)`:** Ensures the invitation address is valid and not the sender's own address.  \n- **External modifier:** Restricts the function to be called only from outside the contract, adding a layer of security.  \n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- **`uint256 amount`:** Represents the number of tokens the user wants to burn.  \n- **`address _invitation`:** An optional address that acts as an invitation or referral. If provided and valid, it associates the sender with this invitation address.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value directly. Instead, it performs several actions:  \n- Registers the user if not already registered.  \n- Associates the user with an invitation address if applicable.  \n- Calculates the equivalent value of the burned tokens in another currency (likely ETH).  \n- Burns the tokens and distributes rewards or fees based on the burned amount.  \n\nIn summary, this function manages the burning of tokens, ensures proper user registration, handles invitations, calculates token value, and distributes rewards, all while implementing security checks to prevent invalid or malicious actions."

This value represents the number of decimal places the token uses. For example, if `_decimals` is 18, it means the token can be divided into 18 decimal places, similar to how Ethereum's Ether is divided into wei.\n\nIn summary, the `decimals` function is a straightforward, read-only function that provides information about the token's decimal precision, ensuring that the token's value is displayed correctly."
