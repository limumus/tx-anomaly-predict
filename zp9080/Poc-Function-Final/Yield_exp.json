    "description": "1. **Core functions:**  \n   This function is designed to handle a flash loan, which is a type of short-term borrowing. It receives tokens, amounts, and fees as inputs and performs a series of operations to manage the loan.

Additionally, the function relies on the integrity of the `USDC`, `YieldStrategy_1`, and `YieldStrategy_2` contracts, assuming they handle transfers and minting/burning securely.
