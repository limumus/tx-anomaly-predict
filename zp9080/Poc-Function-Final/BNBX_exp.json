Security mechanism:\n   The function itself does not contain explicit security mechanisms like access control or input validation. However, it relies on the `vm` object, which is typically part of a testing framework (e.g., Foundry), to safely create a blockchain fork and label addresses. The use of such a framework ensures that these operations are performed in a controlled and isolated environment, minimizing risks to the main blockchain.\n\n3. Parameter Function:\n   The function does not take any parameters. It operates based on predefined constants and addresses (`BNBX`, `WBNB`, `BNBX_0x389a`), which are likely declared elsewhere in the code. These addresses represent specific contracts or tokens that need to be labeled for clarity during testing or deployment.\n\n4. Return description:\n   The function does not return any value.

It lacks explicit security measures but uses basic checks to ensure tokens are available before proceeding. The function does not return any value but logs the attacker's initial balance for reference."
