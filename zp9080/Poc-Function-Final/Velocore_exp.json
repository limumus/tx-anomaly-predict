However, since this is likely part of a testing or setup process, it doesnâ€™t include additional security measures like access control. The use of `vm.createSelectFork` suggests it relies on a testing framework (e.g., Foundry) to handle the simulation securely.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any direct parameters. However, it uses two internal values:  \n   - A URL (`\"https://linea.drpc.org\"`): This specifies the blockchain network to fork from.  \n   - A block number (`5_079_177 - 1`): This indicates the exact block height at which the fork should be created.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value.
