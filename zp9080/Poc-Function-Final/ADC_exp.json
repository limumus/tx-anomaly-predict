After setting up these approvals, it triggers the `startwith` function in the `Helper` contract.

    "description": "1. **Core functions:**  \n   The `joinGame` function allows a user to participate in a game by sending a payment (Ether) to the contract. It checks if the user has a valid ticket and ensures they are not a contract. The function also handles the relationship between the user and their parent (referrer), updates balances in different pools (like the insurance pool and main pool), and calculates earnings based on the user's participation. Additionally, it ensures the game's state is updated correctly.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - **`notContract(msg.sender)`:** Ensures that the caller is not a contract, preventing automated or malicious contract interactions.  \n   - **`require` statements:** These checks ensure that the user cannot refer themselves (`msg.sender != parentAddr`) and that the ticket is valid (`checkTicket(msg.sender, msg.value)`).  \n   - **Balance updates:** The function carefully updates balances in the insurance and main pools, ensuring funds are allocated correctly.  \n   - **Parent-child relationship:** The function verifies and sets the relationship between the user and their parent, preventing invalid or circular references.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   - **`parentAddr`:** This is the address of the user's parent (referrer). The function uses this to establish a relationship between the user and their parent, which is important for calculating earnings and maintaining the game's structure.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value directly. Instead, it performs several internal operations:  \n   - Updates the user's relationship with their parent.  \n   - Distributes the payment into different pools (insurance and main pools).  \n   - Calculates earnings for the user and their parent.  \n   - Updates the game's state to reflect the new participation.  \n\nIn summary, the `joinGame` function enables users to join a game, ensures security through various checks, manages relationships and balances, and updates the game's state without returning a direct value."

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `withdraw` function allows a user to withdraw funds from a pool based on their participation and eligibility. It checks if the user is active and if the pool has sufficient balance for withdrawal. It also calculates the amount the user can withdraw, considering any bonuses or deductions, and transfers the funds to the user's address. Additionally, it updates the pool balance and the user's withdrawal history.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \n- **`require` statements**: These ensure that the user is active, the pool has sufficient balance, and the user has enough funds to cover deductions.  \n- **Conditional checks**: The function verifies if the user is eligible for bonuses from previous rounds and ensures the pool balance is updated correctly.  \n- **Balance adjustments**: The function deducts the withdrawn amount from the pool and updates the user's withdrawal records to prevent double-spending or over-withdrawal.  \n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe function does not take any explicit parameters. Instead, it uses the `msg.sender` address to identify the caller and fetch their associated data, such as their player ID (`pid`) and participation details. This ensures the function operates on the correct user's data.\n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value. Instead, it performs actions such as transferring funds to the user's address, updating pool balances, and recording the withdrawal details. The logic ensures that the user receives the correct amount after applying any bonuses or deductions, and the pool balance is adjusted accordingly.  \n\nIn summary, the `withdraw` function enables users to withdraw funds from a pool while ensuring security through checks and balances. It uses the caller's address to fetch relevant data, calculates the withdrawal amount, and updates the system state to reflect the transaction."

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `buyADC` function allows users to purchase a token called `ADC` by sending Ether (ETH) to the contract. It calculates the amount of `ADC` tokens the user receives based on the amount of ETH sent and a predefined exchange rate. The function also ensures that the contract’s balance is correct and transfers the ETH to a team address. Additionally, it updates the total amount of `ADC` tokens distributed and sets a special flag for users who send a large amount of ETH.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \n- **`require` statements**: These ensure that the ETH sent is above a minimum threshold (`minInPay`) and that the contract’s balance matches the expected amount. These checks prevent invalid transactions and ensure the contract operates correctly.  \n- **`payable` modifier**: Allows the function to receive ETH.  \n- **Balance checks**: The function verifies that the contract’s balance is consistent with the expected amount of `ADC` tokens, preventing mismanagement of funds.  \n- **Transfer to team address**: The ETH sent by the user is securely transferred to a designated team address.  \n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe function does not take any explicit parameters. Instead, it uses `msg.value`, which represents the amount of ETH sent by the user. This value is used to calculate the amount of `ADC` tokens the user will receive.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value directly. However, it performs the following actions:  \n- Calculates the amount of `ADC` tokens (`saleADC`) based on the ETH sent (`msg.value`) and a predefined exchange rate (`changeRatio[curentLevel]`).  \n- Adjusts the `ADC` amount further using the `CrossLevel` function, which likely applies additional logic based on the ETH amount.  \n- Transfers the calculated `ADC` tokens to the user.  \n- Updates the total amount of `ADC` tokens distributed (`totalCheckOut`).  \n\nIn summary,  \nThe `buyADC` function enables users to purchase `ADC` tokens by sending ETH. It ensures the transaction is valid, calculates the token amount based on the ETH sent, and transfers the ETH to a team address. It also updates the total tokens distributed and sets a special flag for large transactions. Security measures include balance checks and minimum ETH requirements to prevent errors and misuse."
