It does this by first looking at a stored variable `_failed`. If `_failed` is true, it returns true. If `_failed` is not true, it checks a specific value stored in a virtual machine (VM) at a predefined location. If that value is not zero, it also returns true, indicating a failure.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   The function uses the `view` modifier, which ensures that it does not modify the state of the contract.

Additionally, the function relies on a VM load operation, which is a secure way to retrieve data from a virtual machine without exposing sensitive information.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any parameters. It operates solely based on the internal state of the contract and the data stored in the VM.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). It returns `true` if either the `_failed` variable is true or if the value loaded from the VM at the specified location is not zero.
