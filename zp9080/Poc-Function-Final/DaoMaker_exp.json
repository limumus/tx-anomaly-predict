It also logs the attacker's token balance before and after the exploit to show the impact.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   The function does not include any explicit security measures. Instead, it demonstrates a potential vulnerability by bypassing access controls (e.g., taking ownership via `init`) and exploiting an `emergencyExit` function to drain funds. This highlights the importance of proper access control and validation in smart contracts to prevent unauthorized actions.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   - `releasePeriods`: An array specifying the duration (in seconds) for token release.
