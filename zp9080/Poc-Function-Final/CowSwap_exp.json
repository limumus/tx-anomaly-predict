    "description": "1. **Core functions:**  \n   The `envelope` function is designed to manage a series of interactions (transactions) with external contracts while ensuring that the financial loss from these interactions does not exceed a predefined limit. It first records the current balances of specified tokens in a vault. Then, it executes the interactions one by one. After all interactions are completed, it checks the new balances of the tokens and calculates the total loss. If the loss exceeds the allowed limit, the function reverts the transaction to prevent further damage.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - **`unchecked` block:** This is used to disable overflow/underflow checks for arithmetic operations, which can save gas but requires careful handling to avoid vulnerabilities.  \n   - **Revert on failure:** If an interaction with an external contract fails, the function reverts with a custom error (`BadInteractionResponse`).  \n   - **Loss control:** The function ensures that the total loss from the interactions does not exceed the `allowedLoss` value. If it does, the transaction is reverted with another custom error (`LostMoreThanAllowed`).  \n   - **External call safety:** The function uses low-level calls (`call`) to interact with external contracts, which is flexible but requires caution to avoid reentrancy attacks or unexpected behavior.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   - **`interactions`:** An array of interaction data, including the target contract address, value to send, and call data for the transaction.  \n   - **`vault`:** The address of the vault where token balances are checked and managed.  \n   - **`tokens`:** An array of token contracts whose balances are monitored.  \n   - **`tokenPrices`:** An array of prices corresponding to each token, used to calculate the total loss in a common unit.  \n   - **`balanceChanges`:** An array of expected balance changes for each token after the interactions.  \n   - **`allowedLoss`:** The maximum allowed loss (in a common unit) that can occur from the interactions.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value. Instead, it performs a series of checks and calculations to ensure the interactions do not result in excessive loss. If the total loss exceeds the `allowedLoss`, the function reverts the transaction. The total loss is calculated by comparing the expected and actual balance changes for each token, converting the difference into a common unit using the token prices, and summing these values.  \n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `envelope` function executes a series of interactions with external contracts while monitoring and controlling the financial loss. It ensures that the loss does not exceed a predefined limit by checking token balances before and after the interactions. The function uses several security measures, such as reverting on failed interactions and enforcing a maximum allowed loss, to protect the system from unexpected outcomes."
