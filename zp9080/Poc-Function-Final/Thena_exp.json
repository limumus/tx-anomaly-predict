    "description": "1. **Core functions:**  \n   The main purpose of these functions is to calculate the amount of a token you would receive (`amountOut`) when swapping a specific amount of another token (`amountIn`). The first function, `getAmountOut`, adjusts the input amount by deducting a fee and then calls the second function, `_getAmountOut`, to perform the actual calculation. The second function uses the reserves of the two tokens in a trading pair to determine the output amount, considering whether the pair is stable or not.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - The `view` modifier ensures that these functions do not modify the state of the contract, making them safe to call without incurring gas costs.  \n   - The `external` modifier restricts the first function to be called only from outside the contract.  \n   - The `internal` modifier limits the second function to be called only within the contract, preventing external access.  \n   - The fee deduction in the first function ensures that the calculated amount accounts for any trading fees, which is a defense against incorrect calculations.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   - `amountIn`: Represents the amount of the token you are swapping.  \n   - `tokenIn`: Specifies the address of the token being swapped.  \n   - `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`: Represent the current reserves of the two tokens in the trading pair.  \n   These parameters are used to determine the output amount based on the reserves and the type of token pair (stable or not).  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The functions return the calculated amount of the token you would receive after the swap. The calculation logic depends on whether the token pair is stable or not. For stable pairs, it uses a more complex formula to ensure the output amount reflects the stable nature of the pair. For non-stable pairs, it uses a simpler formula based on the ratio of the reserves. The final output is adjusted to account for token decimals to ensure accuracy.  \n\nIn summary, these functions calculate the amount of a token you would receive in a swap, considering fees and the type of token pair, while ensuring security through modifiers and proper parameter handling."
