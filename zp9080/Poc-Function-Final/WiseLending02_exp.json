    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `borrowExactAmount` function is designed to allow a user to borrow a specific amount of an underlying asset (like a cryptocurrency) by using an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) as collateral. It ensures that the user can request and receive the exact amount they want to borrow, provided the NFT meets the necessary conditions.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which means it can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring internal contract logic is not bypassed. Additionally, it likely relies on other security measures such as checking the NFT's validity, ensuring the underlying asset is supported, and verifying that the borrow amount does not exceed the NFT's collateral value.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `_nftId`: This is the unique identifier of the NFT being used as collateral.  \n- `_underlyingAsset`: This is the address of the asset (e.g., a cryptocurrency) the user wants to borrow.  \n- `_borrowAmount`: This is the exact amount of the underlying asset the user wishes to borrow.  \n\n4.

The function ensures that the exact amount specified is deposited.\n   - `depositExactAmountETH`: This function is similar to `depositExactAmount`, but it specifically handles the deposit of Ether (ETH) into the system associated with a specific NFT (identified by `_nftId`). The function allows users to send ETH along with the transaction.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**\n   - `external`: Both functions are marked as `external`, meaning they can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring that internal contract logic cannot directly invoke them.\n   - `payable`: The `depositExactAmountETH` function is marked as `payable`, allowing it to receive ETH sent with the transaction. This is a security feature to ensure that only ETH can be sent to this function.\n   - No explicit modifiers like `onlyOwner` or `nonReentrant` are present, so additional security measures (e.g., access control or reentrancy protection) would need to be implemented elsewhere in the contract.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**\n   - `_nftId`: This parameter identifies the specific NFT associated with the deposit. It ensures that the deposit is linked to the correct NFT.\n   - `_underlyingAsset` (in `depositExactAmount`): This parameter specifies the address of the asset being deposited. It ensures that the correct asset is being used for the deposit.\n   - `_amount` (in `depositExactAmount`): This parameter specifies the exact amount of the asset to be deposited. It ensures that the user deposits the precise amount they intend to.\n   - No additional parameters are needed for `depositExactAmountETH` since it handles ETH deposits directly.\n\n4. **Return description:**\n   - Both functions return a `uint256` value, which likely represents some form of confirmation or result of the deposit operation. This could be a transaction ID, a balance update, or another indicator of the successful deposit. The exact calculation logic for the return value is not provided in the code snippet, but it is expected to be related to the outcome of the deposit process.\n\nIn summary, these functions facilitate the deposit of specific amounts of assets (including ETH) into a system linked to a particular NFT. They include basic security measures like `external` and `payable` but may require additional safeguards depending on the broader contract context. The return value likely confirms the success or details of the deposit operation."

    "description": "1. **Core function:**  \n   The `failed()` function checks whether a failure condition has occurred. It first looks at a stored boolean value `_failed`. If `_failed` is true, it returns true. If `_failed` is false, it checks a specific value stored in a virtual machine (VM) at a predefined location. If the value at that location is not zero, it also returns true, indicating a failure.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   The function uses the `view` modifier, which ensures that it does not modify the state of the contract. This prevents any unintended changes to the contract’s data. Additionally, it relies on a VM to securely load and verify the failure condition, adding an extra layer of validation.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any parameters. It operates solely based on the internal state of the contract and the data stored in the VM.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). It returns `true` if either the `_failed` variable is true or if the value loaded from the VM is not zero. Otherwise, it returns `false`, indicating no failure condition has been met.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `failed()` function checks for a failure condition by examining an internal variable and a value stored in a VM. It returns `true` if either condition indicates a failure, otherwise `false`. It is designed to be safe and read-only, ensuring no unintended changes to the contract’s state."

    "description": "1. **Core functions**:  \n   The `test_poc` function is designed to simulate a series of interactions with a lending pool and token system. It starts by allocating tokens to the contract, approving token transfers, and depositing tokens into a pool. It then creates a lending position, deposits and withdraws tokens repeatedly, and finally transfers tokens to another address to simulate borrowing. The function tests the behavior of the lending system under specific conditions, including repeated deposits and withdrawals, and checks how the system handles borrowing limits.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   - **`approve`**: Ensures that the contract has permission to transfer tokens on behalf of the user.  \n   - **`skip(5 seconds)`**: Simulates the passage of time, which could affect lending or borrowing calculations.  \n   - **`vm.startPrank(other)`**: Switches the caller to another address, simulating actions from a different user.  \n   - **`maximumBorrowToken`**: Checks the borrowing limit to ensure safe borrowing practices.  \n   These mechanisms help prevent unauthorized actions, simulate real-world scenarios, and ensure the system operates within safe limits.\n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   - **`pendleLPT`, `poolToken`, `wiseLending`, `wiseSecurity`, `wsteth`, `other`**: These are addresses of tokens, contracts, or users involved in the interactions. They define where tokens are sent, which contracts are interacted with, and who performs actions.  \n   - **`nftId`**: Represents a unique identifier for a lending position.
