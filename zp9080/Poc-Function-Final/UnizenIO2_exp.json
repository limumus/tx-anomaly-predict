It operates solely on internal data (`_failed`) and a value loaded from the VM.\n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `_failed` is `true`, it immediately returns `true`. If `_failed` is not set, it checks a specific value in the VM. If the value in the VM is not zero, it returns `true`, indicating a failure. Otherwise, it returns `false`, meaning no failure has been detected.\n\n**In summary**, the `failed()` function is a simple yet effective way to check for failure conditions in the system, using both a stored variable and a VM value to ensure accuracy.
