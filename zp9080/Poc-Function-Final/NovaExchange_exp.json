It first checks the balance of the `attacker` address before performing an action, then uses a cheat function (`cheats.prank`) to impersonate the `attacker` and call the `rewardHolders` function on the `novaContract` with a large value. After this action, it checks the `attacker`'s balance again to observe the impact. The commented-out section suggests an attempt to swap tokens for ETH, but it failed due to insufficient input amount, likely related to token decimal precision.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   The function uses `cheats.prank(attacker)` to simulate the `attacker` as the caller, which is a testing tool to mimic specific addresses.
