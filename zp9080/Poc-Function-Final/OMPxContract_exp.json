If the user sends more Ether than needed, the excess is refunded.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nSeveral checks are in place to ensure security and fairness:  \n- `require(tokensToPurchase > 0)`: Ensures the user is trying to buy at least one token.  \n- `require(msg.value > 0)`: Ensures the user has sent some Ether.  \n- `require(maxPrice >= 0)`: Ensures the maximum price the user is willing to pay is valid.  \n- `require(currentPrice <= maxPrice)`: Ensures the calculated price does not exceed the user’s specified maximum.  \n- `require(msg.value >= totalDealPrice)`: Ensures the user has sent enough Ether to cover the cost.  \n- Refund mechanism: If the user sends more Ether than needed, the excess is returned to them.  \n- `safeTransfer`: Safely transfers tokens to the user, reducing the risk of errors.  \n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `tokensToPurchase`: The number of tokens the user wants to buy.  \n- `maxPrice`: The maximum price per token the user is willing to pay. This ensures the user doesn’t overpay if the price changes unexpectedly.  \n- `msg.value`: The amount of Ether sent by the user to purchase the tokens.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function returns the number of tokens actually bought by the user (`tokensWuiAvailableByCurrentPrice`). This value is calculated based on the amount of Ether sent, the current price of the tokens, and the number of tokens requested. If the user sends more Ether than needed for the requested tokens, they receive the exact number of tokens they asked for. If there are not enough tokens available, the function mints new tokens to fulfill the request.  \n\nIn summary,  \nThe code allows users to purchase tokens securely by ensuring they don’t overpay, deducting a system fee, and refunding any excess Ether. It also handles edge cases like insufficient token supply by minting new tokens. The function returns the number of tokens successfully purchased by the user."
