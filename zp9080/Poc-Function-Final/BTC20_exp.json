Finally, it calls the `approveAll` function, which likely grants necessary permissions or approvals for interactions with these contracts.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   The function uses the `public` visibility modifier, meaning it can be called by anyone. However, it appears to be part of a testing or setup script rather than a production contract, so security measures like access control are not explicitly implemented here. The use of `vm.createSelectFork` suggests it is part of a testing framework (e.g., Foundry), which isolates the environment from the actual blockchain, reducing risks during testing.\n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   The function does not take any parameters. It operates on predefined contract addresses and labels them using the `vm.label` function. The `vm.createSelectFork` function specifies the blockchain (mainnet) and a block number (17,949,215 - 1) to create a fork, but these values are hardcoded rather than passed as parameters.\n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function does not return any value.
