Essentially, this function is used to detect and confirm if something has gone wrong in the system.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   The function uses the `view` modifier, which ensures that it does not modify the state of the contract.

Additionally, it relies on a virtual machine (`vm`) to load and verify data, which adds a layer of abstraction and security by isolating the failure check from direct contract state manipulation.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any parameters. It operates solely based on the internal state of the contract and the data stored in the virtual machine.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `_failed` is `true`, it directly returns `true`. If `_failed` is not set, it checks a specific value in the virtual machine. If the value in the VM is not zero, it returns `true`, indicating a failure. Otherwise, it returns `false`, meaning no failure has been detected.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `failed()` function is a simple yet effective way to check for failure conditions in the system.
