    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `buyTokens` function allows users to purchase tokens by sending a specific amount of cryptocurrency (BNB) to the contract. It calculates the required BNB value based on the number of tokens the user wants to buy and the token price. It then checks if the user sent enough BNB, ensures the contract has enough tokens to transfer, and finally transfers the tokens to the user. It also updates the total number of tokens sold and emits an event to log the transaction.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \n- `require(msg.value >= _bnbvalue)`: Ensures the user sends enough BNB to cover the cost of the tokens.  \n- `require(tokenContract.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _numberOfTokens)`: Verifies the contract has enough tokens to fulfill the purchase.  \n- `require(tokenContract.transfer(msg.sender, _numberOfTokens))`: Confirms the token transfer to the user was successful.  \nThese checks prevent issues like insufficient funds, insufficient token supply, or failed transfers.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `_numberOfTokens`: Specifies the number of tokens the user wants to buy. This value is used to calculate the required BNB and to transfer the tokens.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return a value directly. Instead, it performs actions like transferring tokens and updating the `tokensSold` variable. The success of these actions is ensured by the `require` statements, which halt execution if any condition fails.  \n\nIn summary,  \nThe `buyTokens` function enables users to purchase tokens by sending BNB.

After the loan is taken, it emits an event to log the attacker's WBNB balance after the exploit.\n\n2.

The balance is obtained by calling `WBNB.balanceOf(address(this))`, which retrieves the WBNB balance of the contract. The balance is then formatted using `WBNB.decimals()` to ensure it is displayed correctly.\n\nIn summary, the `testExploit` function simulates an exploit by taking a flash loan of 10 WBNB and then logs the attacker's WBNB balance after the exploit. It sets the initial BNB balance to zero and relies on the `flashLoan` function from `DPPOracle` to perform the loan. The function does not return a value but emits an event to log the final WBNB balance."
