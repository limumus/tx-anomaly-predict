It operates solely based on internal state variables and VM storage, making it a straightforward check without external inputs.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `_failed` is `true`, it immediately returns `true`. If `_failed` is not set, it checks a specific storage location in the VM.

If these conditions are met twice, it calls another function (`borrowTokens`) to perform the borrowing action.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - The function uses an `external` modifier, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring it is not invoked internally.  \n   - It includes conditional checks (`if` statements) to ensure the function only proceeds when specific conditions are met, preventing unintended actions.  \n   - The function relies on the `callCount` variable to track how many times the conditions have been met, adding a layer of control to prevent misuse.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   - `_from`: Represents the address from which the tokens are being transferred.
