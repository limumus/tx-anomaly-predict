    "description": "1. **Core functions:**  \n   The `distribute` function is responsible for managing the distribution of rewards or funds in a staking system. It checks if the system is initialized, verifies the current staking epoch, and ensures that the distribution is only allowed under specific conditions. If the conditions are met, it either skips the current epoch or proceeds with distributing the available balance to the stakers.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - The function uses `external` to restrict its access to external calls only.  \n   - It checks if the system is initialized using `isInitialized()` and reverts if not.  \n   - For the first epoch, it ensures only the staking contract owner can call the function.  \n   - It enforces a minimum time interval (`minInterval`) between distributions to prevent abuse.  \n   - It reverts if the contract balance or total staked amount is below the required minimums (`MINIMUM_DISTRIBUTION` and `MINIMUM_STAKE`).  \n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any parameters. Instead, it relies on internal checks and external data (e.g., the current epoch and contract balance) to determine its behavior.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value. It either skips the current epoch or distributes the contract's balance to the stakers, depending on the conditions met.  \n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `distribute` function ensures that rewards or funds are distributed fairly and securely in a staking system.

The function first checks if the receiver address is valid. Then, it calculates the total amount of funds and rewards to be withdrawn based on the provided indexes. If there are rewards, they are transferred to the receiver. Finally, the main funds are transferred to the receiver, and two events are emitted to log the withdrawal and reward claims.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - The function uses `external` visibility, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract.  \n   - It checks if the `_receiver` address is valid (not a zero address) to prevent sending funds to an invalid destination.  \n   - The `safeTransfer` method is used to transfer ERC20 tokens, which ensures the transfer is successful or reverts the transaction.  \n   - The `_transferETHOrRevert` function is used to handle ETH transfers, ensuring they either succeed or revert.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   - `_indexes`: A list of indexes that specify which funds or rewards the user wants to withdraw.  \n   - `_receiver`: The address where the withdrawn funds and rewards will be sent.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value directly. Instead, it performs actions:  \n   - It calculates the total amount of funds (`totalAmount`) and rewards (`totalRewards`) to be withdrawn using the `_withdrawMultiple` function.  \n   - If there are rewards, they are transferred to the receiver.  \n   - The main funds are transferred to the receiver using `safeTransfer`.  \n   - Two events (`Claimed` and `Withdrawal`) are emitted to record the details of the withdrawal and reward claims.  \n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `withdraw` function enables users to withdraw funds and rewards securely. It ensures the receiver address is valid, calculates the amounts to withdraw, and transfers them safely. Events are emitted to log the transaction details."

    "description": "1. **Core functions**:  \nThis function is designed to allow users to swap a specific amount of one token (ERC-20) for Ethereum (ETH) while supporting tokens that have transfer fees. It ensures that the swap is executed only if the resulting ETH amount meets or exceeds a minimum specified value. The function is part of a decentralized exchange (DEX) system, enabling users to trade tokens directly without intermediaries.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n- **`external`**: The function can only be called from outside the contract, preventing internal misuse.  \n- **`deadline`**: Ensures the transaction is executed before a specified time, preventing outdated or delayed transactions.  \n- **`amountOutMin`**: Protects users by ensuring they receive at least the minimum expected ETH amount, safeguarding against unfavorable price changes.  \n- **`path`**: Specifies the token swap route, ensuring the transaction follows the intended path.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n- **`amountIn`**: The exact amount of the input token the user wants to swap.  \n- **`amountOutMin`**: The minimum amount of ETH the user expects to receive from the swap.  \n- **`path`**: An array of addresses representing the token swap route (e.g., Token A → Token B → ETH).  \n- **`to`**: The recipient address where the swapped ETH will be sent.  \n- **`deadline`**: The latest time (in Unix timestamp) by which the transaction must be executed.  \n\n4. **Return description**:  \nThis function does not return any value. Instead, it executes the swap directly, transferring the specified amount of tokens and sending the resulting ETH to the designated recipient. The swap is only successful if the output ETH amount meets or exceeds the `amountOutMin` threshold.  \n\n**In summary**, this function facilitates token-to-ETH swaps in a decentralized manner, ensuring users receive a minimum expected amount of ETH while supporting tokens with transfer fees. It includes safeguards like deadlines and minimum output checks to protect users."
