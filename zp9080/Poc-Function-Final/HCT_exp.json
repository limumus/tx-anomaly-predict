These fees are multiplied by 10 and stored in the contract.\n   - The `_burn` function is an internal helper that actually performs the token burning process. It checks if the user has enough tokens to burn, reduces their balance, and updates the total supply of tokens.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**\n   - The `burn` function is public, meaning anyone can call it, but it only allows users to burn their own tokens.\n   - The `updateFee` function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the contract owner can change the fee rates. This prevents unauthorized changes to the fee structure.\n   - The `_burn` function includes a `require` statement to ensure the user has enough tokens to burn, preventing invalid or harmful operations.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**\n   - In the `burn` function, `_value` represents the number of tokens the user wants to burn.\n   - In the `updateFee` function, `_txFee`, `_burnFee`, and `_charityFee` are the new fee rates set by the owner for transactions, burning, and charity, respectively.\n   - In the `_burn` function, `_who` is the address of the user whose tokens are being burned, and `_value` is the number of tokens to burn.\n\n4. **Return description:**\n   - The `burn` and `_burn` functions do not return any values; they simply update the token balances and total supply.\n   - The `updateFee` function also does not return any values; it updates the internal fee rates based on the provided parameters.\n\n**In summary,**\nThese functions manage token burning and fee updates in a secure and controlled manner. The `burn` function allows users to destroy their own tokens, while the `updateFee` function lets the owner adjust fee rates.

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThis function is designed to provide a list of specific functions (called \"selectors\") that are targeted for testing or fuzzing. It allows users to retrieve the list of these targeted selectors in a read-only manner, meaning it does not modify any data on the blockchain.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `view` modifier, which ensures that it does not alter the state of the contract. This is a security measure to prevent unintended changes to the contract's data. Additionally, since it only returns stored data (`_targetedSelectors`), it avoids exposing sensitive or unnecessary information.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThis function does not take any parameters. It simply accesses and returns the stored list of targeted selectors (`_targetedSelectors`) from the contract.\n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function returns an array of `FuzzSelector` objects, which represent the list of targeted selectors. The output is directly taken from the contract's stored data (`_targetedSelectors`) without any additional calculations or modifications.\n\nIn summary, this function is a straightforward way to retrieve a list of targeted selectors for testing purposes, ensuring no changes are made to the contract's state."

It simply retrieves and returns the list of addresses stored in the `_targetedSenders` variable.\n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function returns an array of addresses (`address[] memory`) stored in the `_targetedSenders` variable. The output is a direct copy of this stored list, without any additional calculations or transformations.\n\n**In summary**,  \nThis function is a straightforward, read-only utility that provides a list of addresses marked as \"targeted senders.\" It is secure due to its `view` modifier, which ensures no state changes, and it does not require any input parameters.

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `testExploit` function is designed to simulate an exploit scenario involving a flash loan. It first checks the initial balance of WBNB (Wrapped BNB) held by the contract. Then, it initiates a flash loan with a specified amount (`baseAmount`) and processes the loan. After the flash loan is executed, it calculates the new balance of WBNB and logs the results, showing the changes in the balance before and after the exploit.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which restricts its access to external calls only, preventing internal calls from within the contract. Additionally, it relies on the `flashLoan` mechanism provided by `DPPOracle`, which is typically designed to ensure that borrowed funds are returned within the same transaction. However, the function does not include explicit checks or safeguards to prevent misuse, which could pose security risks if not properly managed.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe function does not take any direct parameters. However, it uses a predefined variable `baseAmount` as the amount for the flash loan. This variable likely represents the quantity of tokens to be borrowed during the flash loan process. The `abi.encode(baseAmount)` encodes this value for use in the flash loan call.\n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value directly. Instead, it logs the results of the exploit simulation. It calculates the integer (`intRes`) and decimal (`decRes`) parts of the final WBNB balance after the flash loan. The integer part is derived by dividing the balance by `1 ether` (representing 1 BNB), and the decimal part is the remainder after subtracting the integer portion multiplied by `1e18`. These values are then logged to show the balance in a human-readable format.\n\nIn summary,  \nThe `testExploit` function simulates a flash loan exploit by checking the initial WBNB balance, executing a flash loan, and logging the balance changes. It uses the `external` modifier for access control but lacks explicit security measures. The function relies on a predefined `baseAmount` for the flash loan and logs the final balance in a readable format without returning any direct value."
