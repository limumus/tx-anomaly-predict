Return description:  \nThe function returns two values:  \n- The first value represents the amount of collateral tokens to be seized.  \n- The second value represents an additional calculation, likely related to fees or adjustments in the liquidation process.  \nThe exact logic for these calculations depends on the underlying system, but the function ensures that the seized collateral is proportional to the repayment amount and adheres to the rules of the protocol.  \n\nIn summary,  \nThe `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` function calculates the collateral to be seized during a liquidation, based on the borrowed token, collateral token, and repayment amount. It is a read-only function that ensures fairness in the liquidation process by determining the appropriate seizure amounts."
