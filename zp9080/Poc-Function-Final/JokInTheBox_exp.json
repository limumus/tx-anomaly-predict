Return description:\n   The function returns an array of addresses (`address[] memory excludedContracts_`). The returned array contains all the contract addresses that have been excluded, as stored in the `_excludedContracts` variable. The logic is straightforward: it directly returns the value of `_excludedContracts`.\n\nIn summary, the `excludeContracts` function is a simple, read-only function that provides a list of excluded contract addresses, ensuring transparency and easy access to this information without altering the contract's state."
