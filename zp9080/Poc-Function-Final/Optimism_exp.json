Otherwise, it returns `false`, meaning no failure has been detected.\n\n**In summary**, the `failed()` function is a simple yet effective tool for detecting failure conditions by checking both an internal state variable and an external VM storage location.

However, since this is likely a setup function for testing purposes, it doesn't include additional security measures like access control. The `cheats.createSelectFork` method is part of a testing framework (e.g., Foundry) and is not intended for use in production, so it doesn't require security mechanisms.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any parameters directly.

These values define the exact state of the blockchain being simulated.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value.
