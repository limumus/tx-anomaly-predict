It uses a tool called `cheats` to create a fork of the Moonriver blockchain at a particular block number (1,442,490). This allows developers to simulate the state of the Moonriver blockchain at that specific point in time, which is useful for testing smart contracts or other blockchain interactions without affecting the live network.\n\n2. Security mechanism:\n   The function itself does not include explicit security mechanisms like access control or input validation because it is primarily used in a testing or development context. However, the use of `cheats.createSelectFork` implies that this function is likely part of a testing framework (e.g., Foundry or Hardhat) where such operations are controlled and isolated from the main network. The function is marked as `public`, meaning it can be called by anyone, but in a testing environment, this is typically not a concern.\n\n3. Parameter Function:\n   The `setUp` function does not take any parameters. It directly calls `cheats.createSelectFork` with two arguments: the name of the blockchain (\"moonriver\") and the block number (1,442,490). These arguments specify which blockchain to fork and at which block height to create the fork.\n\n4. Return description:\n   The `setUp` function does not return any value. Its purpose is purely to set up the environment by creating a fork of the Moonriver blockchain at the specified block number. There is no calculation or output value involved in this function.\n\nIn summary, the `setUp` function is a simple initialization function used in testing or development to create a fork of the Moonriver blockchain at a specific block.
