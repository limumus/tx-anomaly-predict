    "description": "1. **Core functions**:  \n   The `receiveFlashLoan` function is designed to handle a flash loan, which is a short-term borrowing mechanism in decentralized finance (DeFi). The function performs a series of steps to borrow, deposit, withdraw, and swap various tokens across multiple DeFi platforms like Aave, Compound, and Curve. It aims to leverage these platforms to execute complex financial strategies, such as arbitrage or liquidity provision, and then repay the flash loan along with any fees.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   - The function uses `approve` and `safeApprove` to grant permission to other contracts (like Aave, Curve, and Compound) to spend tokens on its behalf. This ensures that only authorized contracts can interact with the tokens.  \n   - The function includes repayment logic at the end, ensuring that borrowed funds are returned to the lender along with the required fees. This is critical to avoid defaulting on the flash loan.  \n   - The function interacts with well-established DeFi protocols (Aave, Curve, Compound), which are generally considered secure and audited.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   - `tokens`: An array of token addresses involved in the flash loan. These are the tokens borrowed and need to be repaid.  \n   - `amounts`: An array of amounts corresponding to the tokens borrowed. These are the principal amounts of the flash loan.  \n   - `feeAmounts`: An array of fees associated with the flash loan. These are the costs for borrowing the tokens.  \n   - `userData`: Additional data that can be passed to the function for custom logic. However, it is not used in this specific implementation.  \n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function does not return any value. Instead, it performs a series of transactions across multiple DeFi platforms. At the end, it transfers the borrowed tokens back to the lender (`msg.sender`) along with the corresponding fees. This ensures the flash loan is fully repaid.  \n\n**In summary**, the `receiveFlashLoan` function is a complex DeFi operation that borrows tokens, executes a series of financial transactions across multiple platforms, and repays the loan with fees. It uses security measures like token approvals and repayment logic to ensure safe and correct execution."

After receiving the loan, it emits a log message showing the attacker's USDT balance after the exploit.\n\n2.

The `tokens` array contains the addresses of the tokens involved in the flash loan (wstETH, WETH, and USDT). The `amounts` array specifies the amounts of each token to be borrowed.
