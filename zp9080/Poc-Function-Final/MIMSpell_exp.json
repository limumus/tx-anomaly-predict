    "description": "1. **Core functions:**  \nThe `deposit` function is designed to handle the transfer of tokens from one address to another. It allows users to deposit a specific amount of tokens into a system or contract, and in return, they receive an equivalent or calculated amount of shares or tokens. This function is commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to manage liquidity or token staking.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \nThe function is marked as `external`, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring controlled access. It also uses `payable`, allowing it to accept Ether (the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum) if needed. The function interacts with the `IERC20` interface, which ensures compatibility with standard ERC20 tokens, reducing risks associated with non-standard token implementations. Additionally, the function likely includes checks to ensure the `from` address has sufficient tokens and that the transfer is authorized, although these details are not visible in the provided code.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n- `token_`: Specifies the ERC20 token to be deposited.  \n- `from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred.  \n- `to`: The address receiving the tokens or shares.  \n- `amount`: The quantity of tokens to be deposited.  \n- `share`: The expected or calculated share amount associated with the deposit.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \nThe function returns two values: `amountOut` and `shareOut`. These represent the actual amount of tokens deposited and the corresponding shares issued, respectively. The calculation logic for these values depends on the internal rules of the contract, such as exchange rates or fee structures, ensuring the user receives the correct amount based on the deposit.  \n\nIn summary, the `deposit` function facilitates token transfers and share issuance in a secure and controlled manner, ensuring compatibility with ERC20 tokens and providing clear outputs for the user."

    "description": "1. **Core functions:**\n   The `swap` function is designed to facilitate a token swap process. It first withdraws a specified amount of tokens from a BentoBox vault, then redeems these tokens for their underlying assets using a Stargate router. After that, it swaps the underlying assets for MIM tokens using a ZeroX exchange proxy. Finally, it deposits the MIM tokens back into the BentoBox vault and calculates the extra shares gained from the swap.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**\n   - **`public override`:** This ensures the function can be called externally and overrides any existing function with the same name in a parent contract.\n   - **`require` statement:** This checks if the balance of the pool tokens is zero after redemption, ensuring that all tokens have been fully redeemed. If not, it reverts the transaction with an error message.\n   - **`revert` statement:** If the swap operation fails, the function reverts with a custom error `ErrSwapFailed`, preventing the transaction from completing with an unsuccessful swap.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**\n   - **`address` (three parameters):** These represent the addresses involved in the swap, including the recipient who will receive the swapped tokens.\n   - **`uint256 shareToMin`:** This is the minimum amount of shares the user expects to receive from the swap.\n   - **`uint256 shareFrom`:** This is the amount of shares the user is willing to swap.\n   - **`bytes calldata swapData`:** This contains the data required for the ZeroX exchange proxy to execute the swap, such as the swap route and parameters.\n\n4. **Return description:**\n   - **`extraShare`:** This is calculated as the difference between the shares returned from the deposit (`shareReturned`) and the minimum shares expected (`shareToMin`).

It is calculated based on the balance of MIM tokens after the swap.\n\n**In summary,**\nThe `swap` function performs a series of operations to swap tokens, redeem them for underlying assets, and then swap those assets for MIM tokens. It includes safety checks to ensure the swap is successful and calculates the extra shares gained from the process. The function parameters define the addresses involved, the amounts to be swapped, and the data needed for the swap. The return values indicate the additional shares gained and the total shares returned after the swap."
