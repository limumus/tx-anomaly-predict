Finally, the stolen tokens are transferred back to the attacker, and the balances are logged again to show the impact of the attack.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   - `cheats.startPrank(attacker)` and `cheats.stopPrank()`: These functions simulate the attacker's actions by temporarily setting the caller to the attacker's address.
