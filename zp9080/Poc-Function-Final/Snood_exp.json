It operates solely based on the internal state of the contract and the data stored in the VM.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `_failed` is `true`, it immediately returns `true`. If `_failed` is not set, it checks a specific value in the VM. If the value in the VM is not zero, it returns `true`, indicating a failure. Otherwise, it returns `false`, meaning no failure has been detected.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `failed()` function is a simple check to determine if a failure has occurred, either through a stored variable or a value in the VM.

The security here relies more on the context in which the function is used (e.g., in a test environment rather than a live production system).\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe function does not take any parameters. Instead, it uses hardcoded values to specify the blockchain (\"mainnet\") and the block number (14,983,660) at which the fork is created. This ensures that the fork is consistent and reproducible for testing purposes.\n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value.

Then, it transfers most of the SNOOD tokens (another cryptocurrency) from the liquidity pool to the attacker's address.

These checks act as safeguards to validate the expected behavior of the attack simulation.\n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   - `attacker`: This is the address of the attacker, which is hardcoded in the function.
