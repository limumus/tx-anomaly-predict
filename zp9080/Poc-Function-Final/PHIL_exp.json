Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which ensures it can only be called from outside the contract, typically by the swap contract itself. Additionally, it relies on the `msg.sender` to identify the swap contract, ensuring only the intended contract can trigger this callback. The function also checks if `amount0Delta` or `amount1Delta` is positive before proceeding with the transfer, preventing unnecessary or invalid transfers.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `amount0Delta` and `amount1Delta`: These represent the changes in the amounts of the two tokens involved in the swap.
