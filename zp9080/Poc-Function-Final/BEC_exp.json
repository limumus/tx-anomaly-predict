It calculates the total amount of tokens to be transferred based on the number of recipients and the specified value per recipient. The function then deducts the total amount from the caller's balance and adds the specified value to each recipient's balance. It also triggers a `Transfer` event for each successful transfer.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   - `whenNotPaused`: This modifier ensures the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused, preventing actions during a paused state.  \n   - `require(cnt > 0 && cnt <= 20)`: This ensures the number of recipients is between 1 and 20, preventing invalid or excessive transfers.  \n   - `require(_value > 0 && balances[msg.sender] >= amount)`: This checks that the specified value is greater than zero and that the caller has enough balance to cover the total transfer amount, preventing insufficient funds or invalid transfers.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   - `_receivers`: An array of addresses representing the recipients who will receive the tokens.  \n   - `_value`: The amount of tokens to be sent to each recipient.  \n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function returns `true` if the batch transfer is successful.
