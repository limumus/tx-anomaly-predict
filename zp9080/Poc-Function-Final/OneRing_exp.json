This allows developers to simulate and interact with the Fantom blockchain as it existed at that block, which is useful for testing smart contracts in a controlled environment.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \nThe function uses the `public` modifier, which means it can be called by anyone. However, since this function is likely intended for testing or setup purposes, it may not require strict access control. The use of `cheats.createSelectFork` suggests that it is part of a testing framework (like Foundry) that provides tools for simulating blockchain states, which is a common practice for ensuring security and correctness in development.\n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \nThe function does not take any parameters.
