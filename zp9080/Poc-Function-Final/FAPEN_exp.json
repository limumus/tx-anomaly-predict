    "description": "1. **Core functions**:  \n   The main purpose of this function is to transfer tokens from one address (`sender`) to another (`recipient`) on behalf of the sender. It ensures that the sender has approved the caller (the person or contract initiating the transfer) to spend a specific amount of tokens. Additionally, it deducts a fee from the transferred amount, sends the remaining amount to the recipient, and transfers the fee to a designated address (likely the contract itself).  \n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   - `onlyValidAmount(amount)`: This modifier ensures that the amount being transferred is valid (likely greater than zero).  \n   - `require(allowances[sender][msg.sender] >= amount, \"Not enough allowance\")`: This check ensures that the caller has sufficient allowance (permission) from the sender to transfer the specified amount.  \n   - `require(currentAllowance >= amount, \"Transfer amount exceeds allowance\")`: This double-check ensures that the allowance is still valid and not exceeded during the transfer process.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   - `sender`: The address from which tokens are being transferred.  \n   - `recipient`: The address receiving the tokens after the fee is deducted.  \n   - `amount`: The total amount of tokens to be transferred before the fee is deducted.  \n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function returns `true` if the transfer is successful. The logic involves calculating a fee based on the `feeBuyer` percentage, deducting the fee from the total amount, transferring the remaining amount to the recipient, and transferring the fee to the contract. It also updates the allowance to reflect the reduced amount after the transfer.  \n\n**In summary**, this function securely transfers tokens from one address to another while deducting a fee. It ensures the caller has proper permission and validates the amount at every step, returning `true` upon successful completion."

    "description": "1. **Core functions**:  \n   The `unstake` function allows a user to withdraw a specified amount of tokens they previously staked. It reduces the staked balance held by the contract and increases the user's personal balance accordingly.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   - `onlyValidAmount(amount)`: This modifier ensures the amount being unstaked is valid (e.g., not zero or negative).  \n   - `require(balances[address(this)] >= amount, \"Not enough staked balance to unstake\")`: This check ensures the contract has enough staked tokens to fulfill the unstake request, preventing over-withdrawal.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   - `uint256 amount`: This parameter represents the number of tokens the user wants to unstake. It must be a valid, positive value and cannot exceed the staked balance in the contract.  \n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function does not return any value. Instead, it updates the balances of the user and the contract directly. The user's balance increases by the unstaked amount, while the contract's staked balance decreases by the same amount.  \n\n**In summary**, the `unstake` function securely allows users to withdraw their staked tokens, ensuring the amount is valid and the contract has sufficient funds to process the request."
