It allows anyone to check who the owner is by simply calling this function. It is a basic utility function that helps in identifying the entity or account that has control over the contract.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \nThe function is marked as `public`, meaning it can be called by anyone, and `view`, which ensures it does not modify the state of the contract. This makes it safe to call without worrying about unintended changes to the contract. Additionally, it is `virtual`, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts if needed.\n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \nThis function does not take any parameters. It simply retrieves and returns the stored `_owner` address from the contract's state.\n\n4. **Return description**:  \nThe function returns the value of `_owner`, which is the address of the contract owner. The logic is straightforward: it directly fetches and returns the stored address without any additional calculations or transformations.\n\n**In summary**, this function is a simple and secure way to retrieve the owner's address from the contract, ensuring transparency and accessibility while maintaining safety through its modifiers."

Additionally, the `virtual` and `override` keywords indicate that this function can be overridden by child contracts, providing flexibility in inheritance.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   This function does not take any parameters. It solely relies on the internal state of the contract to retrieve the symbol.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns the value of `_symbol`, which is a string stored in the contract. The output is the token's symbol, such as \"ETH\" or \"BTC,\" depending on what `_symbol` is set to.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThis function is a simple, read-only utility that returns the symbol of a token.

It checks if the sender has sufficient allowance (permission) to transfer the tokens and updates the allowance accordingly before calling the internal `_transfer` function.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**\n   - Both functions are marked as `external`, meaning they can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring controlled access.\n   - The `transferFrom` function includes a check to ensure the sender has sufficient allowance to perform the transfer, preventing unauthorized transfers.\n   - The use of `uint(-1)` in `transferFrom` represents an unlimited allowance, allowing flexibility in managing permissions.\n   - The `sub` function (likely from a safe math library) is used to subtract the transferred value from the allowance, preventing underflow issues.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**\n   - `transfer` parameters:\n     - `to`: The address receiving the tokens.\n     - `value`: The amount of tokens to be transferred.\n   - `transferFrom` parameters:\n     - `from`: The address from which tokens are being transferred (the owner).\n     - `to`: The address receiving the tokens.\n     - `value`: The amount of tokens to be transferred.\n\n4. **Return description:**\n   - Both functions return a boolean value (`true`) to indicate that the transfer was successful.
