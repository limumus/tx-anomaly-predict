This allows for controlled and safe manipulation of the blockchain environment during testing. The function itself is marked as `public`, meaning it can be called by anyone, but since it appears to be part of a testing setup, it is not intended for use in production. There are no explicit security modifiers like `onlyOwner` or `require` statements, as this function is focused on configuration rather than enforcing access control.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The `setUp` function does not take any parameters. It relies on predefined variables (e.g., `swapX`, `DND`, `BUSD`, `WBNB`, `Router`) and the `cheats` object to perform its tasks. These variables are likely defined elsewhere in the code and represent specific contract addresses or objects.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The `setUp` function does not return any value. Its purpose is purely to set up the environment by creating a blockchain fork and labeling contract addresses, rather than performing calculations or returning data.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `setUp` function is a configuration tool used to prepare a testing environment by forking the Binance Smart Chain at a specific block and labeling key contract addresses.
