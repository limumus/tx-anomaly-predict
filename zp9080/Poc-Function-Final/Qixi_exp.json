The use of `emit` statements for logging helps in monitoring the state changes during the exploit simulation.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe `Pair.swap` function takes four parameters:  \n- `0`: Represents the amount of the first token to swap (set to zero in this case).  \n- `WBNB.balanceOf(address(Pair)) - 1e7`: Specifies the amount of WBNB to swap, calculated as the total WBNB balance of the pair minus a small value (1e7).  \n- `address(this)`: Indicates the recipient address for the swapped tokens (the attacker's address).  \n- `bytes(\"0x123\")`: A placeholder for additional data, which is not used in this context.  \n\n4.
