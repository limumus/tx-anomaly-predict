After these swaps, the function transfers a specified amount of WMATIC tokens back to the Balancer contract to repay the loan.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   - The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, which limits its accessibility.  \n   - There are no explicit access control modifiers (like `onlyOwner`), so it relies on the caller being a trusted entity (e.g., a flash loan provider).  \n   - The function assumes that the `WMATIC_HOPE_PairSwap` and `WMATIC.transfer` operations are secure and properly implemented.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   - `tokens`: An array of token addresses representing the tokens borrowed in the flash loan.  \n   - `amounts`: An array of values indicating the amount of each token borrowed.  \n   - `feeAmounts`: An array of values representing the fees associated with the borrowed tokens.  \n   - `userData`: Additional data that can be passed to the function for custom logic or information.  \n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function does not return any value (it has no `return` statement).
