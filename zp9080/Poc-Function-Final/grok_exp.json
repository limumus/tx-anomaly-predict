Parameter Function:  \nThe `flash` function takes four parameters:  \n- `address(this)`: Specifies the recipient of the flash loan, which is the contract itself.  \n- `0`: Indicates the amount of the first token in the pair to borrow (in this case, zero).  \n- `30_000_000_000_000_000_000`: Specifies the amount of the second token in the pair to borrow (a very large number).  \n- `new bytes(1)`: Provides optional data to pass to the flash loan recipient (in this case, an empty byte array).  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value. Instead, it uses `emit` to log the attacker's WETH balance before and after the flash loan.

    "description": "1. **Core functions:**\n   This function is designed to handle a flash loan callback in a decentralized finance (DeFi) environment, specifically for Uniswap V3.

This prevents unauthorized calls. Additionally, it uses `approve` functions to grant permission to the router contracts to handle tokens, ensuring that only authorized contracts can move tokens. The use of `block.timestamp + 100` for deadlines ensures that transactions are executed within a specific time frame, reducing the risk of stale transactions.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**\n   - `amount0` and `amount1`: These represent the amounts of two tokens involved in the flash loan.
