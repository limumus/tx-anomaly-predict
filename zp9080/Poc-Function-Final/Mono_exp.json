After swapping tokens, it removes liquidity from three users and adds liquidity for the caller. The function then executes multiple token swaps and finally swaps a token for USDC, logging the final USDC balance of the caller.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function includes a few security measures:  \n- `approve` is used to set token allowances, ensuring controlled access to tokens.  \n- `gas: 40_000` limits the gas used for the WETH deposit, preventing excessive gas consumption.  \n- `block.timestamp` ensures the swap transaction is valid only within a specific time frame.  \n- Emitted logs (`emit log_named_uint`) help track balances and actions for debugging or monitoring purposes.  \n\n3.

Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value directly. Instead, it logs key balances (e.g., WETH, MonoToken, and USDC) using `emit log_named_uint`. These logs provide insights into the state of the contract and the results of the actions performed, such as the final USDC balance of the caller.  \n\nIn summary, the `testExploit` function orchestrates a sequence of token-related actions, including approvals, swaps, and liquidity management, while logging key balances for monitoring.
