The function logs the WETH balance before and after the flash loan to track the changes in the contract's holdings.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, adding a layer of control over who can initiate this operation.  \n   - It uses `console.log` to output debug information, which helps in monitoring the function's execution and identifying potential issues.  \n   - The flash loan mechanism itself is a security feature, as it ensures borrowed funds must be repaid within the same transaction, reducing the risk of misuse.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   - `tokens`: An array of token addresses, here containing only WETH, specifying the token involved in the flash loan.  \n   - `amounts`: An array of amounts, here containing `totalBorrowed`, indicating the quantity of WETH to borrow.  \n   - `userData`: An empty byte array, which could be used to pass additional data if needed.  \n   - `totalBorrowed`: The amount of WETH to borrow in the flash loan.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value directly.

It uses basic security measures like `external` visibility and logging, and it calculates the balance in both Ether and Wei to provide detailed insights into the exploit's impact."
