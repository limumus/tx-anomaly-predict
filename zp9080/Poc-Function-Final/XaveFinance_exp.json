    "description": "1. Core functions:\n   The code defines two functions, `addProposal` and `addProposalWithNonce`, which are used to add a new proposal for consideration. The `addProposal` function is a simplified version that calls `addProposalWithNonce` with a default nonce value of 0. The `addProposalWithNonce` function handles the creation of a proposal by generating a unique question string, checking for validity, and interacting with an oracle to register the proposal. It also emits an event to notify that a proposal question has been created.\n\n2. Security mechanism:\n   The code includes several security checks to ensure the integrity of the proposal process. It uses `require` statements to enforce conditions such as ensuring that a proposal has not already been submitted (`questionIds[questionHash] == bytes32(0)`), that a previous proposal was invalidated (`oracle.resultFor(currentQuestionId) == INVALIDATED`), and that the generated question ID matches the expected one (`expectedQuestionId == questionId`). These checks help prevent duplicate proposals, invalid proposals, and unexpected behavior.\n\n3. Parameter Function:\n   - `proposalId`: A unique identifier for the proposal.\n   - `txHashes`: An array of transaction hashes that are part of the proposal.\n   - `nonce`: A value used to ensure the uniqueness of the proposal question, especially when retrying after invalidation.\n\n4. Return description:\n   The functions do not return any value directly. Instead, they interact with an oracle to register a proposal question and emit an event (`ProposalQuestionCreated`) to indicate that a new proposal question has been created. The event includes the generated `questionId` and the `proposalId` for tracking and verification purposes.\n\nIn summary, the code is designed to add and manage proposals securely by generating unique questions, validating inputs, and interacting with an oracle to ensure the integrity of the proposal process."

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `buildQuestion` function is designed to create a unique question identifier by combining a proposal ID and a list of transaction hashes. It first calculates a single hash from the list of transaction hashes and then merges this hash with the proposal ID to form the final question identifier. This is useful in scenarios where a unique identifier is needed to reference a specific proposal and its associated transactions.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `pure` modifier, which ensures that it does not read or modify the state of the contract. This makes the function safe from potential state-related vulnerabilities. Additionally, the function relies on cryptographic hashing (`keccak256`) to securely process the transaction hashes, ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of the generated question identifier.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `proposalId`: This is a string that represents the unique identifier of a proposal. It is used as part of the final question identifier.  \n- `txHashes`: This is an array of transaction hashes (represented as `bytes32` values). These hashes are combined and hashed again to create a single, unique value that is included in the final question identifier.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function returns a string that is created by concatenating the `proposalId`, a special separator (`bytes3(0xe2909f)`), and the hashed value of the transaction hashes (`txsHash`). This combined string serves as the unique question identifier, ensuring that it is both specific to the proposal and tied to the associated transactions.  \n\nIn summary,  \nThe `buildQuestion` function generates a unique question identifier by combining a proposal ID and a list of transaction hashes. It uses cryptographic hashing to ensure the integrity of the output and is designed to be secure and stateless. The resulting identifier is a concatenation of the proposal ID, a separator, and the hashed transaction data."

    "description": "1. **Core functions**:  \nThe `testAttack` function is designed to simulate an attack on a decentralized system. It performs several actions:  \n- It creates a proposal to mint a massive amount of RNBW tokens (100,000,000,000,000) and assigns them to the attacker's address.  \n- It transfers ownership of three different assets (RNBW_TOKEN, LPOP_TOKEN, and PRIMARY_BRIDGE) to the attacker's address.  \n- It submits the proposal to a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) module and executes it after a 24-hour delay.  \n- Finally, it logs the results before and after the execution of the proposal to show the changes in ownership and token balances.  \n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \nThe function does not include explicit security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or misuse. Instead, it relies on the DAO_MODULE to handle the proposal and execution process. However, the function uses `vm.startPrank` and `vm.stopPrank` to simulate the attacker's contract as the caller during execution, which could bypass certain security checks if not properly implemented in the DAO_MODULE.  \n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \nThe function does not take any external parameters. However, it uses predefined constants and addresses (e.g., `ATTACKER_EOA`, `RNBW_TOKEN`, `LPOP_TOKEN`, `PRIMARY_BRIDGE`) to specify the target of the attack. These values are hardcoded into the function, meaning the attack is tailored to specific addresses and tokens.  \n\n4. **Return description**:  \nThe function does not return any value. Instead, it emits logs to display the state of the system before and after the attack. These logs include the ownership of the tokens and the attacker's RNBW token balance, which helps to verify the success of the attack.  \n\n**In summary**, the `testAttack` function simulates an attack on a decentralized system by minting a large number of tokens and transferring ownership of assets to the attacker. It relies on the DAO_MODULE to handle the proposal and execution process but lacks built-in security measures to prevent misuse. The function uses hardcoded addresses and emits logs to show the results of the attack."
