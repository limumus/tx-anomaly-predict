The `view` modifier ensures that the function does not modify the state of the contract, meaning it only reads data without making any changes.

Essentially, it acts as a failure detector by examining both internal and external states.\n\n2. **Security mechanism**:  \n   The function uses the `view` modifier, which ensures that it does not modify the state of the contract, making it safe to call without incurring gas costs or altering data. Additionally, it relies on a VM load operation to retrieve external data, which is a secure way to interact with external systems without exposing the contract to direct manipulation.\n\n3. **Parameter Function**:  \n   This function does not take any parameters. It operates solely based on internal and external states (`_failed` and the VM-stored value).\n\n4. **Return description**:  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `_failed` is true, it directly returns `true`. Otherwise, it checks if the value stored in the VM under the key `\"failed\"` is non-zero. If the VM-stored value is non-zero, it returns `true`, indicating a failure. If both checks are false, it returns `false`, meaning no failure has been detected.\n\n**In summary**, the `failed()` function is a simple yet effective way to detect failure conditions by checking both internal and external states.
