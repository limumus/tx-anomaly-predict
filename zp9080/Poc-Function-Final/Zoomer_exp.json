The function is designed to automate these steps in a loop, repeating the process five times.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which means it can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring that internal functions cannot accidentally trigger it.

Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which means it can only be called from outside the contract.

The function interacts with a router contract to execute the swap.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \n- The function uses `approve` to grant the router contract permission to spend the user's tokens up to a specified maximum amount (`amountInMax`). This limits the router's access to the user's funds.  \n- The `block.timestamp + 120` ensures the transaction has a time limit, preventing it from being stuck indefinitely.  \n- The function is `public`, meaning it can be called by anyone, but it requires the caller to have the necessary tokens and approve the router beforehand.  \n\n3.
