    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `exitPool` function allows a user to withdraw their funds from a pool. It calculates the amount of tokens the user will receive based on their share of the pool, deducts any applicable fees, and transfers the tokens to the user. Additionally, it handles the distribution of fees to a designated beneficiary if applicable. Finally, it reduces the total supply of pool tokens by burning the user's tokens.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \n- The `noReentry` modifier prevents reentrancy attacks, ensuring the function cannot be called multiple times before it completes.  \n- The `require(!this.getLock(), \"POOL_LOCKED\")` check ensures the pool is not locked before allowing the withdrawal.  \n- The `require(tokenBalance.sub(tokenAmount) >= MIN_AMOUNT, \"TOKEN_BALANCE_TOO_LOW\")` and `require(totalSupply.sub(_amount) >= MIN_AMOUNT, \"POOL_TOKEN_BALANCE_TOO_LOW\")` checks ensure that token balances do not fall below a minimum threshold.  \n- The use of `safeTransfer` ensures safe token transfers to the user.  \n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `_amount`: This parameter represents the amount of pool tokens the user wants to withdraw. It determines how many underlying tokens the user will receive after fees are deducted.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return a value directly. Instead, it performs calculations to determine the amount of tokens the user receives, deducts fees, and transfers the tokens to the user. It also burns the user's pool tokens and emits an event (`PoolExited`) to log the transaction.  \n\nIn summary, the `exitPool` function enables users to withdraw funds from a pool while handling fees and ensuring security through various checks and mechanisms."

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `joinPool` function allows a user to add funds to a pool by specifying the amount they wish to contribute. It ensures the pool is not locked, calculates any applicable fees, and distributes the user's contribution across the pool's underlying assets. If fees are applicable, a portion is allocated to a designated beneficiary. Finally, the function mints tokens to the user representing their share in the pool and emits an event to log the transaction.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `noReentry` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks, ensuring the function cannot be called repeatedly before it completes. It also includes `require` statements to enforce conditions such as the pool not being locked (`!this.getLock()`), the total supply not exceeding the pool's cap (`totalSupply.add(_amount) <= this.getCap()`), and ensuring the token amount is not too small (`tokenAmount != 0`). Additionally, it uses `safeTransferFrom` for secure token transfers.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe `_amount` parameter represents the amount of funds the user wants to add to the pool. This value is used to calculate the user's share of the pool's underlying assets, determine any applicable fees, and mint tokens to the user.\n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value. Instead, it performs actions such as transferring tokens, minting new tokens to the user and the beneficiary (if applicable), and emitting an event to record the transaction.\n\nIn summary,  \nThe `joinPool` function enables users to contribute funds to a pool while ensuring security through reentrancy protection and validation checks. It calculates fees, distributes the user's contribution across the pool's assets, and mints tokens to represent their share. The function does not return a value but performs actions and emits an event to log the transaction."
