Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which restricts its access to external calls only, meaning it cannot be called internally within the contract. This ensures that the setup process is initiated from outside the contract, adding a layer of control over when and how the environment is prepared.\n\n3.

After the transfer, it triggers a flash loan from the `Pool` contract, borrowing 85 ether on behalf of the `attacker`. This function is likely used for testing or demonstrating how an exploit might work in a controlled environment.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses `vm.prank` to simulate a transaction from a specific address, which is a common tool in testing environments to mimic user actions.
