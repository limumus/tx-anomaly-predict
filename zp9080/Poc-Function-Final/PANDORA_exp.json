Additionally, it includes a commented-out line that would set the balance of WETH (Wrapped Ether) for the contract's address to zero, though this line is not currently active.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which means it can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring it is not invoked internally by other functions within the contract.

The commented-out `deal` line suggests that the function could be extended to manipulate token balances, but this feature is currently disabled, reducing potential risks.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe function does not take any explicit parameters. However, it implicitly relies on the `cheats` object and the `WETH` address, which are likely defined elsewhere in the contract or testing environment.
