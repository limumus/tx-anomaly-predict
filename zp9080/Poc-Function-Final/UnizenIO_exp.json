Security mechanism:  \nThe function itself does not include explicit security mechanisms like access control or input validation. However, it operates in a controlled testing environment (likely using a tool like Foundry's `vm` cheat codes) where the blockchain state can be manipulated safely.

It then logs the effects of the attack on the victim’s token balance and approvals. The function is primarily used for testing and does not include security mechanisms to prevent attacks."
