    "description": "1. **Core functions:**  \n   This function is designed to provide the total amount of tokens that currently exist in the system. It acts as a simple way to check the overall supply of tokens at any given time.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   The function is marked as `public`, meaning anyone can call it, and `view`, which ensures it does not modify the state of the contract. This makes it safe to use without risking unintended changes to the contract's data. The `override` keyword indicates it is replacing a function from a parent contract, ensuring consistency in behavior.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   This function does not take any parameters. It only retrieves and returns the value of `_totalSupply`, which is a variable storing the total token supply.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns the value of `_totalSupply`, which represents the total number of tokens in circulation. No calculations are performed; it simply reads and returns this stored value.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThis function is a straightforward way to check the total token supply in the system. It is safe to use, does not require any input, and directly returns the stored value of `_totalSupply`."

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `transfer` function is designed to move a specified amount of tokens from the sender's account to another recipient's account. It acts as a bridge to facilitate the transfer of tokens between two addresses in a token contract.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `public` and `virtual override` modifiers. The `public` modifier ensures the function can be called by anyone, while `virtual override` allows it to be customized or extended in derived contracts. Additionally, the function relies on an internal `_transfer` function, which likely includes checks to ensure the sender has enough tokens and that the transfer is valid.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `recipient`: This is the address of the person or contract that will receive the tokens.  \n- `amount`: This specifies the number of tokens to be transferred from the sender to the recipient.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function always returns `true` to indicate that the transfer was successful. However, the actual success of the transfer depends on the internal `_transfer` function, which handles the logic of moving the tokens.  \n\nIn summary, the `transfer` function is a simple yet essential tool for moving tokens between accounts, ensuring the process is secure and straightforward."

    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `transferFrom` function is designed to move a specific amount of tokens from one account (the sender) to another account (the recipient). It is commonly used in scenarios where a third party (like a smart contract or another user) is authorized to transfer tokens on behalf of the sender.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function includes the `external` modifier, which ensures it can only be called from outside the contract, preventing internal misuse. Additionally, it typically requires prior approval from the sender (via an `approve` function) to ensure that only authorized parties can transfer tokens on their behalf. This approval mechanism acts as a key defense measure to prevent unauthorized transfers.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `sender`: The address of the account from which tokens are being transferred.  \n- `recipient`: The address of the account receiving the tokens.  \n- `amount`: The number of tokens to be transferred from the sender to the recipient.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) to indicate whether the transfer was successful. If the transfer completes without issues, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false` if the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance or lack of approval).\n\nIn summary, the `transferFrom` function facilitates the transfer of tokens from one account to another, ensures security through external access and approval mechanisms, and provides feedback on the success of the operation."
