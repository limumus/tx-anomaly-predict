Additionally, the function emits logs to track the attacker's balance before and after the exploit, which can be useful for monitoring and detecting suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any parameters.

Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `external` modifier, which restricts its access to external calls only, meaning it cannot be called internally within the contract. This helps prevent unintended internal interactions. Additionally, the `calldata` keyword is used for the `amounts` parameter, which ensures that the data is read-only and stored in a temporary location, reducing gas costs and enhancing security. The `min_mint_amount` parameter acts as a safeguard, ensuring that the user receives at least a minimum amount of liquidity tokens in return, protecting against unfavorable conditions like slippage.\n\n3.
