After these approvals, the function performs a token swap using the `Pair.swap` method, exchanging a specified amount of tokens. Finally, it emits an event to log the attacker's WBNB balance after the exploit.\n\n2. Security mechanism:\n   The function does not explicitly include security mechanisms like access control or reentrancy guards.

Instead, it emits an event (`log_named_decimal_uint`) that logs the attacker's WBNB balance after the exploit. The balance is calculated by calling `WBNB.balanceOf(address(this))`, which retrieves the WBNB balance of the current contract address. The balance is then logged with a precision of 18 decimal places.\n\nIn summary, the `testExploit` function simulates an exploit by setting maximum token allowances, performing a token swap, and logging the attacker's WBNB balance.
