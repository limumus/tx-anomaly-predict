This array contains the list of artifacts that have been excluded. The calculation logic is simple: it directly fetches and returns the pre-stored list (`_excludedArtifacts`) without any additional processing.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThis function is a read-only utility that provides access to a list of excluded artifacts.

Essentially, it acts as a status checker for failure conditions.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   - The function is marked as `public view`, meaning it can be called by anyone but does not modify the state of the contract.

It relies solely on internal state (`_failed`) and external storage (VM) to determine the result.  \n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `_failed` is `true`, it directly returns `true`. If `_failed` is not set, it checks a specific storage location in the VM. If the value at that location is not zero, it returns `true`, indicating a failure. Otherwise, it returns `false`, meaning no failure has been detected.  \n\n**In summary,**  \nThe `failed()` function checks for failure conditions by examining both an internal variable and a VM storage location.
