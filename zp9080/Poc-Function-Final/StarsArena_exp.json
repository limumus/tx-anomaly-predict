The function sends 1 ether to `victimContract` along with a specific encoded function call.\n\n2. Security mechanism:\n   The function uses `deal` to manipulate the contract's balance, which is typically used in testing environments to simulate certain conditions. The `call` method is used to send ether and data to `victimContract`, and it includes a `success` check to ensure the transaction was executed. This helps in verifying whether the exploit attempt was successful or not.\n\n3. Parameter Function:\n   The function does not take any external parameters. However, it uses `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode a function call with specific parameters: the contract's own address (`address(this)`), a boolean value (`true`), and again the contract's own address (`address(this)`). These parameters are passed to `victimContract` as part of the exploit attempt.\n\n4. Return description:\n   The function does not return any value directly. Instead, it logs the contract's balance before the exploit attempt and uses a `success` boolean to indicate whether the call to `victimContract` was successful.
