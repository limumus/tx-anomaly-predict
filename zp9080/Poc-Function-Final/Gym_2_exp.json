Parameter Function:  \nThe function does not take any direct parameters. However, it internally uses the `createSelectFork` method, which requires two arguments:  \n- `\"bsc\"`: Specifies the blockchain network to fork, in this case, Binance Smart Chain.  \n- `18_501_049`: The block number at which the fork is created, allowing the simulation of the blockchain state at that specific point in time.\n\n4.
