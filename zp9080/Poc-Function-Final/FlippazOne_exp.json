    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `testExploit` function is designed to simulate an attack on a contract called `FlippazOne`. It first checks the balance of the `FlippazOne` contract before the attack. Then, it places a bid of 2 ether into the contract. After the bid, it attempts to drain all the ether from the `FlippazOne` contract by calling the `ownerWithdrawAllTo` function, sending the funds to an address named `alice`. Finally, it logs the balances of both the `FlippazOne` contract and `alice` after the attack.\n\n2.
