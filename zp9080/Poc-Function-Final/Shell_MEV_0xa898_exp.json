However, since this appears to be a setup function for testing purposes, it doesn’t include specific security measures like access control.

It lacks explicit security measures but uses low-level `call` interactions and logging to monitor the attack's effects. The function targets two victims and reduces their BUSD balances while tracking the attacker's balance changes."
