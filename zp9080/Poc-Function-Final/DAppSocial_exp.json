Parameter Function:  \n- `token`: This parameter specifies the address of the token (either USDT or USDC) that the owner wants to withdraw.  \n- `withdraw`: This boolean parameter determines whether the withdrawal operation should be performed. If set to `true`, the function proceeds with the withdrawal; otherwise, it does nothing.\n\n4. Return description:  \nThe function does not return any value.

The `drainToken` function is called with the addresses of these tokens as parameters, which specifies which tokens to drain. The helper contract (`HelperExploitContract`) is also instantiated without parameters but plays a critical role in the exploit.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function does not return any value. Instead, it emits log events to display the attacker's token balances before and after the exploit. These logs use `log_named_decimal_uint` to format the balances with the appropriate decimal places (6 for USDT and the token's own decimals for USDC).
