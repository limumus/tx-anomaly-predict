This allows developers to test their smart contracts in a controlled environment that mimics the real blockchain state at that block.\n\n2. **Security mechanism:**  \n   The function does not include explicit security mechanisms like access control or input validation because it is likely intended for testing purposes. However, the use of `cheats` suggests it is part of a testing framework, which inherently isolates the function from affecting the live blockchain, ensuring safety during development.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   The function does not take any parameters.

Finally, it performs the swap and logs the updated token balance after the exploit.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \nThe function does not include explicit security mechanisms such as access control or input validation.
