It directly accesses the `_name` variable, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns the value of the `_name` variable, which is a string. No additional calculations or transformations are performed; it simply provides the stored name as-is.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThis function is a straightforward way to fetch and return the name stored in the contract. It is secure, read-only, and does not require any input parameters."

It simply retrieves and returns the value of `_symbol`, which is likely a predefined variable in the contract storing the token's symbol.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns the value of `_symbol`, which is a string representing the token's symbol. The calculation logic is straightforward: it directly fetches and returns the stored symbol without any additional processing.\n\n**In summary,**  \nThis function is a simple utility that provides the symbol of a token.

Security mechanism:  \nThe function includes a key security check: it verifies if the caller (`msg.sender`) has an unlimited allowance (`uint(-1)`) to transfer tokens on behalf of the `from` account.
