    "description": "1. Core functions:  \nThe `flashLoan` function allows users to borrow assets temporarily without requiring collateral. The borrowed assets are sent to a specified receiver address, and the user must return the borrowed assets plus any interest within the same transaction. This is useful for quick financial operations like arbitrage or refinancing.\n\n2. Security mechanism:  \n- The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, ensuring controlled access.  \n- It uses `calldata` for parameters like `assets`, `amounts`, `interestRateModes`, and `params`, which ensures data is read-only and reduces gas costs.  \n- The function likely includes internal checks to ensure the borrowed assets are returned with interest within the same transaction, preventing misuse.  \n\n3. Parameter Function:  \n- `receiverAddress`: The address that will receive the borrowed assets.  \n- `assets`: A list of asset addresses (e.g., tokens) to be borrowed.  \n- `amounts`: The corresponding amounts of each asset to borrow.  \n- `interestRateModes`: The type of interest rate (e.g., fixed or variable) applied to each loan.  \n- `onBehalfOf`: The address that will be responsible for repaying the loan.  \n- `params`: Additional data that can be used for custom logic during the loan.  \n- `referralCode`: A code used to track referrals or specific loan programs.  \n\n4. Return description:  \nThis function does not return any value. Its purpose is to execute the flash loan process, sending assets to the receiver and ensuring they are returned with interest within the same transaction.  \n\nIn summary, the `flashLoan` function enables temporary borrowing of assets for quick financial operations, with built-in security measures to ensure the loan is repaid promptly. The parameters define the details of the loan, such as the assets, amounts, and interest rates, while the function itself does not return any value."
