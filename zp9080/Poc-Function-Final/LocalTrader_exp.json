Additionally, the function only reads from the `_excludedArtifacts` variable, ensuring that the original data remains secure and unaltered.\n\n3. **Parameter Function:**  \n   This function does not take any parameters. It simply accesses the internal `_excludedArtifacts` variable to retrieve the list of excluded artifacts.\n\n4. **Return description:**  \n   The function returns the value of `_excludedArtifacts`, which is a list of strings representing the excluded artifacts. The output is a direct copy of this list, providing a clear view of what has been excluded.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as a read-only mechanism to access and display a list of excluded artifacts, ensuring the data remains secure and unmodified."

Security mechanism:  \nThe function uses the `public` modifier, meaning it can be called by anyone. However, since it appears to be part of a testing setup, it likely relies on the context of a testing framework (like Foundry) to restrict its use to appropriate scenarios. The `deal` function is a testing utility that safely assigns funds without introducing real-world security risks.\n\n3. Parameter Function:  \nThe function does not take any parameters.
