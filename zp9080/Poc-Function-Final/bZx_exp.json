Next, it calculates a specific amount of YFI tokens to borrow from a liquidity pool (YFI_WETH).

The `_burn` function is an internal helper that performs the actual token burning by adjusting the user's balance and the total supply.\n\n2. Security mechanism:\n   The `burn` function is marked as `public`, meaning it can be called by any external user. The `_burn` function is `internal`, restricting its use to within the contract or derived contracts. The `require` statement in `_burn` ensures that the user cannot burn more tokens than they currently hold, preventing unauthorized or excessive token destruction.\n\n3. Parameter Function:\n   - `_value` (in `burn`): Specifies the amount of tokens the user wants to burn.\n   - `_who` (in `_burn`): Represents the address of the user whose tokens are being burned.\n   - `_value` (in `_burn`): Specifies the amount of tokens to be burned from the user's balance.\n\n4. Return description:\n   Neither function returns a value. Instead, they modify the state of the contract by reducing the user's token balance and the total supply. Additionally, they emit two events: `Burn` to log the burning action and `Transfer` to indicate the tokens were sent to the zero address (a common way to represent token destruction).\n\nIn summary, these functions allow users to destroy their tokens, reducing the total supply, while ensuring they cannot burn more tokens than they own. The process is secured through access control and validation checks."
